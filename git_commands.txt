** Git commands **

git status
git add/rm <file>
git commit -m "Commit message."

git push
or
git push -u origin <branch_name>

git branch <branch_name2>        # create a new branch           Ex.: git branch fix/something
git checkout <branch_name2>      # switch to the <branch_name2>  Ex.: git checkout fix/something

When you want to merge your feature branch (fix/something) into the master branch:
git checkout master
git fetch
git merge fix/something
git push
git branch -d fix/something             # delete LOCALLY the branch "fix/something" if it has already been pushed and merged with the remote branch. 
                                        # use -D instead if you want to force the branch to be deleted, even if it hasn't been pushed or merged yet.
git push origin --delete fix/something  # delete REMOTELY the branch "fix/something"
